🚢 Titanic Survival EDA: A Deep Dive into 100+ Exploratory Data Analysis Steps
From Data to Discovery — An End-to-End Journey Through One of History’s Most Famous Disasters, Revisited with Modern Data Science
“The data has a story to tell. This is the story of who lived, who died, and why — told through statistics, visualization, and machine learning.” 

📜 Project Overview
This repository presents a comprehensive, production-grade Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster dataset from Kaggle . But this isn’t just another EDA.

This is a data-driven autopsy of the RMS Titanic disaster — a forensic examination of passenger demographics, socioeconomic status, travel behavior, and survival outcomes using 100+ unique analytical techniques, ranging from basic histograms to advanced statistical modeling, clustering, and counterfactual reasoning.

We don’t just ask: “Who survived?”
We ask:

“Why did they survive?”
“Would they have survived if they were male? Poorer? Alone?”
“Did families die together? Did class determine fate?”
“Can we detect hidden passenger archetypes?”
This project is designed for data scientists, analysts, and learners who want to move beyond surface-level insights and master the art and science of EDA.

🧩 Why This Project Stands Out
Most Titanic EDA notebooks stop at:

“Women and children first”
“First class survived more”
A few bar plots and a correlation matrix
This one doesn’t.

Here, you’ll find:

✅ 100+ Unique EDA Steps — No repetition. Each insight builds on the last.
✅ Advanced Statistical Testing — KS tests, Cramer’s V, Anderson-Darling, point-biserial correlation.
✅ Machine Learning for Insight — Clustering, PCA, GMM, Isolation Forest — not for prediction, but for understanding structure.
✅ Feature Engineering from Text — Extracting Title, Deck, FamilySize, and even social status from name length.
✅ Counterfactual & Fairness Analysis — Simulating “what if” scenarios to detect bias.
✅ Survival Gradients & Change Points — Detecting thresholds where survival probability shifts.
✅ Vulnerability Index — A composite metric inspired by UN poverty indices.
✅ Family Fate Modeling — Did families share survival outcomes?
✅ 20 Mini Plots Dashboard — A single figure summarizing the entire EDA.
✅ Kaggle-Ready, Report-Ready, Portfolio-Ready

This isn’t just data analysis — it’s data storytelling with technical depth.

🏁 Conclusion
The Titanic disaster was a tragedy shaped by class, gender, and circumstance.

This EDA reveals how data science can uncover hidden patterns in history — not just to predict, but to understand, explain, and question.
